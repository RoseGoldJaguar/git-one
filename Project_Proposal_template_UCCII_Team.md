**Project Description**

This website provides educational advice and tips on health and wellness to those aged 50-65, although anyone older can reap the site's benefits. It advertises free events (online and in-person) to those who view it in addition to helpful information.  It aims to improve the physical and mental health of those who visit it.  The easy-to-find menus and links feature ideas and concepts for physical and psychological wellness and lifestyles.  These features provide an overall positive experience for users.

**Possible benefits of the project**

1. Free online programs and classes
2. In-person programs and classes (optional)
3. Informational pages and standalone tips for temporary users
4. Stress relief community activities
5. Leisure activities online and in-person
6. Users can request welfare checkups

Compared to the website above our website will offer a more user-friendly and event-focused approach, providing its visitors with practical health advice and easy navigation.

**Estimated duration of the project**
It may take anywhere between 1-3 months, including planning, designing, creating content, and testing the site.

**UI/UX and User-Centric aspects of the project**
It also provides easy-to-reach contact information, technical support, and a helpline at the bottom of the page.  In addition, accessibility features are shown near the top and bottom for those needing it.  Its graphical user interface includes standard website color coding and larger text size for findability and readability.  A second attribute the GUI uses is photographic and abstract visuals that match the tone of the website’s purpose.  The site will aim to review feedback to satisfy its visitors.
