**Project Description**

This website provides educational advice and tips on health and wellness to those aged 50-65, although anyone older can reap the site's benefits. It advertises free events (online and in-person) to those who view it in addition to helpful information.  It aims to improve the physical and mental health of those who visit it.  The easy-to-find menus and links feature ideas and concepts for physical and psychological wellness and lifestyles.  These features provide an overall positive experience for users.
