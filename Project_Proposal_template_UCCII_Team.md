**Project Description**

Put the description of your project here - 1 paragraph will suffice.

Do mention who your target users are.

**Possible benefits of the project**

List the benefits that you foresee the project will bring to the
intended user base.

**Current/similar Solutions**

List of similar sites.

1.  If none exists, you need to mention that your site is the first of
    its kind.

2.  If any exists, then mention how your site would be different from
    those so that people know you are merely re-inventing the wheel.

**Estimated duration of the project**

This can be an educated guess and does not have to coincide with the
semester.

In real life, however, you will have to make a pretty accurate
estimation based on different techniques available in project
management.

**UI/UX and User-Centric aspects of the project**

List the things you will do to make the site user-centric and UX
compliant.
